# AWS EC2 DevOps Automation - Internship Assignment 2 IAM + S3 + Automation

### What Was Done:

1. IAM Roles Created:

- Role_A: Read-only access to S3
- Role_B: Write-only (upload only) access to S3

2. EC2 Instance:

- Launched EC2 with Role_B attached
- Verified Role_B can upload files to S3

3. S3 Bucket:

- Bucket name: tech-eazy-akshata-logs
- Created in region: ap-south-1
- Lifecycle rule: auto-delete logs after 7 days

4. deploy.sh Script Updated:

- Script uploads a dummy log file to the S3 bucket:
  aws s3 cp dummy.log s3://tech-eazy-akshata-logs/sample-log-<timestamp>.log

5. Role_A Tested:

- Verified that Role_A can list files in the S3 bucket using:
  aws s3 ls s3://tech-eazy-akshata-logs
